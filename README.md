Hey, I'm Rijvi Mahmud, a frontend developer with 3+ years of experience. I work with React.js, Next.js, TypeScript, ShadCN UI, Tanstack, Zustand, and Node.js, building clean and efficient user interfaces.

I started my career remotely, and over time, well-known companies have trusted me for my reliability, ability to meet deadlines, clear communication, teamwork, and leadership skills. I believe in delivering high-quality software while staying available and adaptable to any situation.

I'm someone who loves challenges, learns fast, and can work both independently and as part of a team. Whether it's planning things down to the last detail or working under tight deadlines, I stay focused and get the job done. I constantly improve by solving problems, reading documentation, and researching how other developers approach things.

I also have a solid understanding of software best practices, SDLC, SOLID principles, and OOP, which help me write scalable and maintainable code.
